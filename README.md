Introduction

This project simulates a dynamic ad hoc sensor network where nodes are dynamically added, removed, and connected based on real-time interactions. It incorporates basic cross-layer concepts like power-aware communication, dynamic topology management, and node connectivity. This project is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it lightweight and easily executable

Key Features

1. Dynamic Node Management

Add Node: Adds a new node at a random location with an initial power level of 100.

Remove Node: Removes the last added node.

Reset Network: Clears all nodes and resets the network.



2. Power-Aware Simulation

Each node has an associated power level.

Power depletes as nodes interact during the simulation.

Visual feedback on each node's power level.



3. Real-Time Network Visualization

Canvas-Based Network: Nodes and connections are drawn on an HTML <canvas> element.

Nodes are displayed as blue circles with power levels shown above them.

Connections between nodes are represented by green lines.



4. User Interaction

Buttons to control the network simulation:

Add Node

Remove Node

Simulate

Reset




5. Information Display

Displays the total number of nodes dynamically.

Provides visual updates based on network status.

Technologies Used

1. HTML: Structure and layout of the application.


2. CSS: Styling for better user experience.


3. JavaScript: Logic for node management, network simulation, and power updates.

Cross-Layer Design Concepts Demonstrated

1. Power-Aware Communication:

Nodes simulate power consumption with each interaction. This reflects real-world power constraints in wireless sensor networks.



2. Dynamic Topology Management:

Nodes can be dynamically added and removed, simulating changing network topologies.



3. Information Sharing and Visualization:

Real-time visualization of nodes, power levels, and connections enhances understanding of network behavior.
